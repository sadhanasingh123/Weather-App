# Weather-App 
The Weather App is a web application built with Flask that provides real-time weather updates and air quality information for any city in the world. Users can enter the name of a city to get detailed weather forecasts and air quality index (AQI) data, helping them stay informed about both local weather conditions and pollution levels.

Features
Real-Time Weather Data: Get up-to-date weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather conditions like clear skies, rain, or snow.
Hyper-Local Weather Reports: The app delivers localized weather forecasts based on the user's city for more accurate data.
Air Quality Index (AQI): Provides real-time AQI information, indicating the level of air pollution in the selected city, along with the main pollutants.
Weather Descriptions: Brief summaries of the current weather (e.g., sunny, overcast, etc.) to give users a quick snapshot of conditions.
Multi-City Support: Enter any city in the world to retrieve weather and air quality data.
How It Works
API Integration: The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and the AirVisual API to get air quality information.
User Input: Users enter a city name, and the app processes the input to fetch and display relevant data.
